# Configuration Requirements for hexa CLI

## Configuration Model
- Provide a hierarchical configuration system where user-global settings are the base and more specific scopes override them (project, current directory, runtime sources).
- Ensure configuration sources are merged so users can override only the keys they need without redefining the full structure.
- Allow discovery of a project-level configuration file by walking up from the current working directory to the user's home directory.
- Support runtime overrides through environment variables using a consistent prefix and key mapping strategy.
- Permit command-line flags to override configuration values at runtime with the highest precedence.

## Default Configuration Lifecycle
- Ship a default configuration template that can be customized with user-specific placeholders during installation.
- Provide an initialization flow that installs the default configuration when none exists.
- Track a configuration version to detect when an upgrade is required and trigger migrations accordingly.
- Preserve user customizations during upgrades while applying changes introduced by new template versions.
- Handle configuration writes safely so partial failures do not corrupt existing files.

## Distribution Integration
- Integrate with the Homebrew formula so that installation and upgrade steps invoke the configuration initialization/upgrade logic automatically.
- Ensure the CLI can verify configuration freshness during startup without blocking normal usage when the configuration directory is unavailable or read-only.

## CLI Capabilities
- Offer `hexa config` subcommands to initialize, inspect, validate, and edit configuration files across different scopes.
- Expose a command to display the effective configuration after all layers are merged for troubleshooting.
- Provide non-interactive flags (e.g., `--if-missing`, `--force`) so automation and package managers can run configuration tasks safely.
- Supply validation tooling that checks configuration structure and reports errors clearly.
- Deliver shell autocompletion support so users can explore commands and flags efficiently.

## User Experience
- Document how configuration keys map to environment variables for quick overrides.
- Ensure users can immediately run core commands after installation using the default configuration.
- Support project-level isolation so teams can store configuration alongside source code without affecting global settings.
- Present changelog information during upgrades, highlighting differences between current and new versions and pointing users to any required configuration actions.
